# Image Classification with CNN and Quantization using CIFAR-10 Dataset

This repository contains code for image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and quantization techniques on the CIFAR-10 dataset.


Dataset


The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are mutually exclusive and there is no overlap between them.
